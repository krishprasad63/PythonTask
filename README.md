Hi, 
This small project is about to generate 1000 files of different extensions and separate them later with repective extension.
Firstly, there is a python file named Generate.py whose task is to generate 1000 files(no. of files to be genrated can be changed by changing the value of n).
For this to be done, you have to first create the fixed_address which could be anything, but for simplpicity, I recommend you to follow following steps:
1.Open C
2.Then users
3.Then your respective system name(in my case:krish)
4.Create folder named PythonTask.
5.Copy the address.
6.Paste it to the value of fixed_address variable.
7.Create folder named random in PythonTask folder.
8.Now, you can run Generate.py
After running Generate.py, n files of given different extensions from the list specified in code will be generated in random folder.

First part of our task is being done. Now, our task is to traverse the random folder, and check that how many different extensions files are there and to create respective folders for each extension file, and finally move the respective files of specific extension to their respective extension folder. As a result, all files of random folder will be moved to their respective extension folders. For example, if it if css folder,then there will be only css files.

For this to be done, you have to first follow following steps.
1.Open Access.py
2.Set fixed_address as of Generate.py .
3.Run Access.py.

Files will be separated, and moved to their respective extension folder.

Thank You,
Signing off,
